M3PA: Analyzing Payoff 
Feature Payoff Distribution: Employed loops to display payoffs for all possible dice roll combinations based on pre determined calculations.
Refactoring, F(R1, R2, R3): Restructured code by encapsulating payoff computation into a function.
Refactoring, Recursive Functions and Loops: Utilized recursive functions to replace nested loops, implementing iterative processes for dice roll calculations.
